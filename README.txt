To play Tic Tac Toe, run the Main.py script

This is a rather messy implementation of the minimax algorithm and the Monte Carlo tree search.

Try to play against the AI, it's fairly smart for just a bunch of 1's an 0's! It can be pretty dumb at times, however.

To make a move, type in the numbers 0 - 8. Each number corresponds to a tile:
0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8

Type -1 to reset the game

If you type in a number less than -1 or greater than 8, the program will exit!
