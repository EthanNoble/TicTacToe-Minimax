To play Tic Tac Toe, run the Main.py script

This is an implementation of the minimax algorithm and the Monte Carlo tree search.

It might take a while to load the computer's moves when you run the script. Be patient!

Try to play against the AI, it's very smart for just a bunch of 1's and 0's!

To make a move, type in the numbers 0 - 8. Each number corresponds to a tile:
0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8

Type -1 to reset the game
